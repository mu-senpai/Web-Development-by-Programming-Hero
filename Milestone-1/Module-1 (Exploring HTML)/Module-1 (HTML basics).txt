Anchor tag to open the hyperlink in the new tab: <a href="#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Link</a>
-however, on FireFox at least if you do two underscores target="__blank" it will open in a new tab, but clicking other links using the same double underscore, opens the new pages in the previous new tab, meaning you only have one additional tab open.
-The rel="noopener noreferrer" is to prevent the newly opened tab from being able to modify the original tab maliciously. You no longer need to use rel="noopener" while using target="_blank", it is added by default source.
